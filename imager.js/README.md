# Imager.js [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/BBC-News/Imager.js.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/BBC-News/Imager.js)

> Imager.js is an alternative solution to the issue of how to handle responsive image loading, created by developers at [BBC News](http://responsivenews.co.uk/).


## Why?

There are many responsive image solutions in the wild: `srcset`, `src-n`, `PictureFill` and so on. They are either
**verbose** or **hard to debug** (and to maintain/integrate). Some of them don't deal well with *pixel density*
and suffer from **double asset payload** (meaning you end up downloading assets unnecessarily).

We wanted something **simple**, which **works** and which is **fast** as well as network friendly (only download what you need, when you need it).

Imager implements the  [BBC Responsive News technique](http://responsivenews.co.uk/post/50092458307/images) which incorporates:

- loading any image once
- loading the most suitable sized image

## How does it work?

Imager runs through the following workflow:

1. lookup **placeholder elements**
2. replace **placeholders** with transparent images
3. update `src` attribute for each image and assign the best quality/size ratio URL

Finally, it will lazy load images to speed up page load time even further.

## Compatibility

Imager is tested against the following mobile and desktop browsers:

- Chrome stable
- Firefox stable
- IE 8, 9, 10 and 11
- Safari 5, 6 and 7
- Mobile Safari 4, 5, 6 and 7
- Android 2, 3 and 4


## Install

npm                            | bower                            | old school
-------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`npm install --save imager.js` | `bower install --save imager.js` | [download zip file](https://github.com/BBC-News/Imager.js/archive/master.zip)


## Using

```html
<div style="width: 240px">
    <div class="delayed-image-load" data-src="http://placehold.it/{width}" data-alt="alternative text"></div>
</div>

<script>
    new Imager({ availableWidths: [200, 260, 320, 600] });
</script>
```

This will result in the following HTML output:

```html
<div style="width: 240px">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/260" data-src="http://placehold.it/{width}" alt="alternative text" class="image-replace">
</div>

<script>
    new Imager({ availableWidths: [200, 260, 320, 600] });
</script>
```

`260` has been elected as the best available width (as it is the closest upper size relative to `240` pixels).

### Pixel Ratio / HiDPI / Retina

Let's say we have generated 4 sizes of images (`200`, `260`, `320` and `600`)
in 3 different pixel ratio flavours (`1`, `1.3` and `2`):

```html
<div style="width: 240px">
    <div class="delayed-image-load" data-src="http://example.com/assets/{width}/imgr{pixel_ratio}.png" data-alt="alternative text"></div>
</div>

<script>
    new Imager({ availableWidths: [200, 260, 320, 600], availablePixelRatios: [1, 1.3, 2] });
</script>
```

The `img[src]` will be computed as following (according to the reported `window.devicePixelRatio` value by the device):

- `http://example.com/assets/260/imgr.png` if no pixel ratio is detected, or advertised as `1`
- `http://example.com/assets/260/imgr-2x.png` if pixel ratio is advertised as `2` (or any value greater than 2)
- `http://example.com/assets/260/imgr-1.3x.png` if pixel ratio is advertised as `1.3`

Head to this [device pixel density test](http://bjango.com/articles/min-device-pixel-ratio/) resource to learn more about the available pixel ratio for your device.

### Interpolating `{width}` value

Imager has the ability to replace `{width}` with a non-numeric value if you
provide the `widthInterpolator` option, which is a function that returns the
string to be injected into the image URL for a given width. This feature allows you to use a human readable name or integrate with third-party image providers.

```html
<div style="width: 240px">
    <div class="delayed-image-load" data-src="http://example.com/assets/imgr-{width}.png" data-alt="alternative text"></div>
</div>

<script>
    new Imager({
        availableWidths: [200, 260, 320, 600],
        widthInterpolator: function(width, pixelRatio) {
          return width + 'x' + (width / 2);
        }
    });
</script>
```

The `img[src]` will be computed as `http://example.com/assets/imgr-260x130.png` instead of `http://example.com/assets/imgr-260.png`.

Alternatively you can define `availableWidths` as an `Object` where the key is the width, and the value is the string to be injected into the image URL.

```html
<div style="width: 240px">
    <div class="delayed-image-load" data-src="http://example.com/assets/imgr-{width}.png" data-alt="alternative text"></div>
</div>

<script>
    new Imager({
        availableWidths: {
            200: 'square',
            260: 'small',
            320: 'medium',
            600: 'large'
        }
    });
</script>
```

The `img[src]` will be computed as `http://example.com/assets/imgr-small.png` instead of `http://example.com/assets/imgr-260.png`.

### Mixing various configurations

You might want to generate HiDPI responsive images. But what if you also include images from another provider which
serves a totally different set of sizes, without pixel ratio?

Here is an example to serve your own images alongside [Flickr images](http://www.flickr.com/).

```html
<div style="width: 240px">
    <div class="delayed-image-load"        data-src="http://placehold.it/{width}" data-alt="alternative text 1"></div>
    <div class="delayed-flickr-image-load" data-src="//farm5.staticflickr.com/4148/4990539658_a38ed4ec6e_{width}.jpg" data-alt="alternative text 2"></div>
</div>

<script>
    var imgrPlaceholder = new Imager('.delayed-image-load', {
        availableWidths: [200, 260, 320, 600]
    });

    var imgrFlickr = new Imager('.delayed-flickr-image-load', {
        availableWidths: {
            150: 't_d',
            500: 'd',
            640: 'z_d'
        }
    });
</script>
```

This will result in the following HTML output:

```html
<div style="width: 240px">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/260" data-src="http://placehold.it/{width}" alt="alternative text 1" class="image-replace">
    <img src="//farm5.staticflickr.com/4148/4990539658_a38ed4ec6e_d.jpg" data-src="//farm5.staticflickr.com/4148/4990539658_a38ed4ec6e_{width}.jpg" alt="alternative text 2" class="image-replace">
</div>
```

### Passing a collection of elements

You might want to pass a NodeList or an array of **placeholder elements** as the first argument rather than a class selector.

```html
<div style="width: 240px">
    <div class="delayed-image-load" data-src="http://placehold.it/{width}" data-alt="alternative text"></div>
</div>

<script>
    var placeholderElems = document.querySelectorAll('.delayed-image-load');
    var imgrPlaceholder = new Imager(placeholderElems, {
        availableWidths: [200, 260, 320, 600]
    });
</script>
```

This will result in the following HTML output:

```html
<div style="width: 240px">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/260" data-src="http://placehold.it/{width}" alt="alternative text" class="image-replace">
</div>
```

# Background

This is an experiment in offering developers an interim solution to responsive images based on the [ImageEnhancer](https://gist.github.com/Integralist/6157139) concept researched and developed by the team at BBC News.

At present, support for `srcset` and `PictureFill` are not widespread and the polyfills for these solutions also come with a number of drawbacks.

[Mark McDonnell (@integralist)](http://twitter.com/Integralist) documented the process and rewrote the original code so it could be evolved and improved with the help of the open-source community.

The goal of this project is to automate the process with the help of the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) JavaScript task runner (potentially via `grunt-responsive-images` for image generation based on a source directory).

Much of this work can be repurposed to work with a more standards-based approach once support improves in modern browsers.

For the purposes of maintaining a distinguishment between the ImageEnhancer concept built by BBC News and this project, we're calling it **Imager.js**
